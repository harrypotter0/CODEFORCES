# Competitive Programming 

An effort to put all templates(dS + Algo) under one repo during the course time of May 2016 - Present .

All the templates and standard algorithms are correct upto my knowledge. Feel free to contibute :)

Hope it might be useful :)

(Note : Try to share your thoughts and experience of competative coding in your github  profile, it might be useful for others.)
